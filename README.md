# BJNTitanicSurvivorshipModelShinyApp
ui.R and server.R files

These 2 files pertain to the Coursera Data Products class and the Shiny Application assignment.  This is the code behind my Shiny Application for my Titanic survivorship model.

Note accompanying files:   
a) shiny app on shiny server: https://betsynash.shinyapps.io/bjntitanicsa2/   
b) Rpresentation slides: http://rpubs.com/BetsyNash/378005


Grading Criteria:

•	Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?  
•	Did the application run as described in the documentation?  
•	Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?  
•	Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?  
•	Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?  
•	Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? Note, it's OK if the app is simple and based on the one presented in class. I just don't want it to be basically a carbon copy of the examples we covered. For example, if someone simply changed the variable names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had a similar layout would be fine.  
•	Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.
